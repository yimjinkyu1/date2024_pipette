# [DATE 2024] Pipette: Automatic Fine-grained Large Language Model Training Configurator for Real-World Clusters

It is common to use a cluster of GPUs with 3D parallelism, which splits a model along the data batch, pipeline stage, and intra-layer tensor dimensions. However, the use of 3D parallelism produces the additional challenge of finding the optimal number of ways on each dimension and mapping the split models onto the GPUs. We propose Pipette, which is an automatic fine-grained LLM training configurator for real-world clusters. By devising better performance models along with the memory estimator and fine-grained individual GPU assignment, Pipette achieves faster configurations that satisfy the memory constraints. We evaluated Pipette on large clusters to show that it provides a significant speedup over the prior art.

## Motivation
We diagnose that these methods tend to have three main limitations that restrict their practical use in the field.
1) Static Interconnect Assumption. The existing methods sim- ply assume that the interconnects between the servers are static, with a fixed bandwidth and latency. However, the actual communication latency in a real cluster exhibits heterogeneity among the links [9]â€“[11], which could yield unexpected straggler effects.
2) Hidden Critical Path. The existing methods construct latency models on the 3D parallelism but miss some critical paths. This comes from the discrepancy between the latency model and modern scheduling. While the state-of-the-art latency models [8], [12] assume outdated scheduling methods to achieve maximal throughput, the de facto standard is to use memory-efficient scheduling [5], [13] to relieve the memory capacity requirements.
3) Out-of-Memory Configurations. The configurations rec- ommended by the automated tools often require more memory per GPU than what is physically available. This is because those methods do not consider the memory usage of LLM [8] at all or fail to estimate it [12].

### Overall Steps

#### 1. See merge4 folder (Megatron-LM-2.5 > strategy > merge4)
    
In the folder above, there are codes that comprehensively summarize the algorithms described in the paper on pipette. Specifically, the file llm_train_strategy_assignment_total_v3.py contains the entire code for finding the optimal 3D configurator.

The files csv_to* generate scripts automatically to facilitate program execution.   

#### 2. See predict_model (Megatron-LM-2.5 > strategy > merge4 > predict_model)

The folder contains code to train an MLP model that predicts the expected GPU memory usage during training of the LLM model.

#### 3. Run training (Megatron-LM-2.5 > script > *.sub)

The *.sub files in the above folder are executable files that include code for testing, profiling, and storing experimental results. Please refer to the file named date_testid_a100_a_merge_64gpu_after_date_testid1_a_submit.sub for execution.

### Some Tips

To find the optimal 3D configurator, it is essential that the nccl test runs successfully and that a model for predicting memory usage is prepared. If there is no memory prediction model available, the corresponding section should be excluded from the llm_train_strategy_assignment_total_v3.py file. Additionally, profiling of the computation times for forward and backward operations on a single GPU should be done in advance. It is recommended to follow these guidelines for smooth operation.
